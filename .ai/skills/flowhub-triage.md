# flowhub-triage — Slash Command

Read open tasks from the user's Vikunja Inbox, propose target projects from the live project list, and (on the user's accept) move them.

**Flags in `$ARGUMENTS`:**

- `--limit N` — cap how many inbox tasks are processed in one run (**default 10**).
- `--simulate` — do not move tasks. On accept, attach two labels per task instead: `triage-target:<project-or-action>` and `triage-conf:<high|medium|low>`. Inbox fetches in this mode automatically exclude any task that already carries a `triage-target:*` label (idempotent — safe to re-run).
- `--only-issues` — after classification, hide any row whose action ≠ `issue`. Use this to focus the proposal table on issue candidates (typically QuickTask-origin dev todos) and avoid mixing move/create+move rows into the same batch.

> **Sibling skill:** `/flowhub-capture` writes new captures into the Inbox. This skill only reads + reorganises; it never creates new tasks (only new projects, on explicit accept).

## Steps

### Step 1 — Resolve credentials (Passbolt → Vikunja token)

Identical to `/flowhub-capture` step 1. Retrieve the Passbolt master password from your memory file `passbolt-password.md`, then:

```bash
PASSBOLT_PASSWORD='<from memory: passbolt-password.md>'
VIKUNJA_TOKEN=$(passbolt get resource \
  --id c9e732ce-7737-49a7-9879-dd81258083af \
  --serverAddress "https://passbolt.home.freaxnx01.ch" \
  --userPrivateKeyFile ~/.config/passbolt/private.asc \
  --userPassword "$PASSBOLT_PASSWORD" \
  --mfaMode none 2>&1 | awk -F': ' '/Password/ {print $2}')
```

If empty → stop with "Could not retrieve Vikunja API token from Passbolt."

### Step 2 — Resolve Inbox project id

```bash
INBOX_ID=$(curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $VIKUNJA_TOKEN" \
  https://todo.home.freaxnx01.ch/api/v1/user \
  | python3 -c 'import json,sys; print(json.load(sys.stdin)["settings"]["default_project_id"])')
```

### Step 3 — Load the live project catalogue

```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $VIKUNJA_TOKEN" \
  "https://todo.home.freaxnx01.ch/api/v1/projects?per_page=200" \
  > /tmp/flowhub-projects.json
```

Read it and remember every `(id, title)` pair *except* the inbox itself. This is the **only** universe of projects the classifier may propose. Never invent project ids or titles outside this list.

### Step 4 — Load open inbox tasks

The Vikunja inbox can easily exceed one page. **Always paginate** — `per_page` is capped server-side and a single request will silently drop later tasks.

```bash
page=1
> /tmp/flowhub-inbox.jsonl
while :; do
  resp=$(curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $VIKUNJA_TOKEN" \
    "https://todo.home.freaxnx01.ch/api/v1/projects/$INBOX_ID/tasks?per_page=200&page=$page")
  n=$(echo "$resp" | python3 -c 'import json,sys; print(len(json.load(sys.stdin)))')
  [ "$n" = "0" ] && break
  echo "$resp" | python3 -c 'import json,sys
for t in json.load(sys.stdin): print(json.dumps(t))' >> /tmp/flowhub-inbox.jsonl
  page=$((page+1))
  [ "$page" -gt 20 ] && break   # safety cap: 4000 tasks
done
```

Then filter to entries where `done == false`. Cap at the user-supplied `--limit` (default 10).

When `--simulate` is active, also drop any task that already carries a label whose title starts with `triage-target:`. This keeps the simulation loop idempotent — once you've labeled a task, subsequent runs ignore it until you either remove the labels or perform a real move.

If the filtered list is empty, print `Inbox is empty — nothing to triage.` and stop.

**Issue-candidate bias from origin:** the user's `quicktask-vikunja` Android app captures dev-oriented todos — tasks from that app are strong candidates for `issue` rather than `move`. Detect the origin by any of these signals:

- title matches `^Screenshot_.*_ch\.freaxnx01\.quicktask_vikunja\.(jpg|png)$`
- any attachment filename contains `ch.freaxnx01.quicktask_vikunja`
- description is empty **and** title is a bare URL or ends with a bare URL (Android share-sheet capture)

When an origin signal fires, bump the classifier's preference toward `issue <rel>/<repo>` for that row (see Step 6). Never silently drop these — they are real todos.

### Step 5 — Enrich each task (only when needed)

Enrichment feeds the classifier. Run whichever of the two branches below fits; skip both when the task's own text is already descriptive.

#### 5a — URL enrichment (WebFetch)

Use WebFetch on a URL from the title or description when **either**:
- the title length is < 30 characters, **or**
- the title matches `^https?://` (a bare URL).

Enrichment prompt: *"Return only: page title, plus a one-sentence summary of what this page is about. No commentary."*

#### 5b — Image enrichment (Read tool)

Trigger when the task has at least one attachment with a `file.mime` starting `image/`, **and** the title gives little signal (e.g. `Image`, empty, or < 30 chars). This catches Signal-captured screenshots and photos.

Download each such attachment and Read it (the Read tool accepts JPEG/PNG and returns the visual content to the model):

```bash
# For each (task_id, attachment_id) pair:
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $VIKUNJA_TOKEN" \
  "https://todo.home.freaxnx01.ch/api/v1/tasks/$TASK_ID/attachments/$ATTACHMENT_ID" \
  -o "/tmp/flowhub-images/task${TASK_ID}_file${ATTACHMENT_ID}.${EXT}"
```

Then call the **Read** tool on the downloaded path. Use what you see to extract: a short one-line description of the image's subject, any visible text/URLs, and whether it's a screenshot, a photo, or a scanned document. That becomes the synthetic "enriched title" for classification.

Hard limits — skip image enrichment when any of these hold:
- the file is > 10 MB (skip with reason `image too large`);
- the mime isn't `image/jpeg`, `image/png`, `image/webp`, or `image/gif`;
- the task already has a descriptive title (≥ 30 chars and not literally `Image`).

Cache all enrichment results in memory for use during classification — never refetch, never re-download.

### Step 6 — Classify each task

Load the repo catalogue (local + remote, all forges) for issue candidates — this is the only universe of legal issue targets:

```bash
source $HOME/projects/repos/github/freaxnx01/public/config/shell/clrepo.sh
_clrepo_remote_list 0 > /tmp/flowhub-repos.list
```

Each line is `<rel>/<repo>` where `<rel>` is `github/<owner>/{public,private}` | `gitlab/<owner>` | `git-forgejo`.

For each task, propose **one** of:

- **`issue <rel>/<repo>`** — the task reads like a bug report, feature request, or dev TODO for a specific repo. Prefer this action when **either** of these holds:
  - the origin signal fires (see Step 4 — QuickTask-origin bias), **or**
  - the enriched content mentions a repo name from the catalogue as a substring, **or**
  - the content has clear dev signals (error messages, stack traces, "fix", "bug", "TODO", "implement", a github.com/gitlab.com URL pointing at one of the user's repos).

  On apply, this dispatches to `/flowhub-issue <task-id>` which reuses the forge-specific issue-creation logic.

- **`move <project_id>`** — an existing project from the catalogue (Step 3) that fits the task. The proposal text should show the project's `title` for human readability.
- **`create+move <new-project-name>`** — only if no existing project fits. Choose a clean, short German title that matches the user's existing naming style (look at the catalogue for cues — the user mixes German and English). Examples of names already present: `Bücher`, `Movies`, `Zitate/Quotes`, `IT Homelab`, `Reiseliste`.
- **`skip`** — if the task is genuinely uncategorisable, ambiguous, or appears to be transient noise.

Prefer `issue` only when confidence is medium or higher; on low confidence, fall back to `move` / `skip` and let the edit walk escalate if the user insists.

Self-rate confidence as `high` / `medium` / `low`:

- **high** — single, obvious match (a clear movie title, a clear book ISBN URL, a clear quote)
- **medium** — multiple plausible matches, or weak topical signal
- **low** — best guess only; user should review carefully

### Step 7 — Print proposal table

Print a markdown table to stdout. Columns:

```
 # | Title (≤50 chars)                            | →  Proposed                | Conf   | Action
---+----------------------------------------------+----------------------------+--------+-----------
 1 | Sisu: Road to Revenge                        | →  Movies (#55)            | high   | move
 2 | Quote: Information is the resolution …       | →  Zitate/Quotes (#72)     | high   | move
 3 | https://example.com/random-thing             | →  (none) create "Notizen" | low    | create+move
 4 | reminder buy milk                            | →  (none)                  | low    | skip
```

Below the table, print a one-line summary like `5 tasks: 3 move, 1 create+move, 1 skip`.

### Step 8 — Ask once: apply / cancel / edit

Ask the user literally:

```
Apply all? [y / N / edit]
```

- **y** → proceed to Step 9 (apply).
- **N** or empty → print `no changes made.` and stop.
- **edit** → enter Step 8b.

#### Step 8b — Per-row edit walk

For each non-skipped row, ask:

```
[i/N] <title>
   current: → <proposal> (<conf>)
   accept / change <project-id-or-name> / skip / done?
```

- **accept** → keep the current proposal
- **change <id>** or **change <title-substring>** → look up that project in the catalogue (Step 3); if multiple match, ask the user to disambiguate by id; replace the proposal
- **skip** → set the row's action to `skip`
- **done** → break out of the loop early (remaining rows keep their current proposals)

After the walk, re-print the updated proposal table and ask `Apply all? [y / N]` once more.

### Step 9 — Apply

Process rows sequentially. **For every action, always send `title` in the payload** (Vikunja returns HTTP 412 otherwise — confirmed via the Vikunja memory file).

#### 9-sim — `--simulate` branch (label-only)

When `--simulate` is active, **do not touch `project_id`** for any row. Instead, for each row (including `skip`), attach two labels to the task:

- `triage-target:<project-or-action>` — project title for `move`, `"create:<new-project-name>"` for `create+move`, `"(skip)"` for `skip`. (No `flowhub-issue` case here — issue detection is handled elsewhere in the skill and treated as `move` from the label's perspective.)
- `triage-conf:<high|medium|low>`

Label resolution is get-or-create — Vikunja rejects attaching a label id that doesn't exist yet:

```bash
# Try to find existing label by title; create if absent. Returns the id on stdout.
get_or_create_label() {
  local title="$1"
  local id
  id=$(curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $VIKUNJA_TOKEN" \
         "https://todo.home.freaxnx01.ch/api/v1/labels?s=$(python3 -c 'import urllib.parse,sys; print(urllib.parse.quote(sys.argv[1]))' "$title")" \
       | python3 -c 'import json,sys; ls=json.load(sys.stdin); print(next((l["id"] for l in ls if l["title"]==sys.argv[1]), ""))' "$title")
  if [ -z "$id" ]; then
    local body
    body=$(python3 -c 'import json,sys; print(json.dumps({"title": sys.argv[1], "hex_color": sys.argv[2]}))' "$title" "$2")
    id=$(curl -s -X PUT \
           -H "Authorization: Bearer $VIKUNJA_TOKEN" \
           -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
           -d "$body" \
           "https://todo.home.freaxnx01.ch/api/v1/labels" \
         | python3 -c 'import json,sys; print(json.load(sys.stdin)["id"])')
  fi
  echo "$id"
}
```

Suggested palette (second arg to `get_or_create_label`):

| Label prefix | Color |
|---|---|
| `triage-target:` | `a0a0ff` (soft blue) |
| `triage-target:(skip)` | `808080` (grey) |
| `triage-conf:high` | `22c55e` (green) |
| `triage-conf:medium` | `eab308` (amber) |
| `triage-conf:low` | `ef4444` (red) |

Attach both labels to the task:

```bash
for lid in "$TARGET_LABEL_ID" "$CONF_LABEL_ID"; do
  curl -s -w "\n__HTTP_%{http_code}__" -X PUT \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $VIKUNJA_TOKEN" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d "{\"label_id\":$lid}" \
    "https://todo.home.freaxnx01.ch/api/v1/tasks/$TASK_ID/labels"
done
```

In simulate mode **do not** attach the `flowhub-triaged` label — that label signals a real move has happened, and tasks carrying it would be hidden from a later non-simulate run.

Per-row output line:

```
~ #3 Sisu: Road to Revenge ↪ label triage-target:Movies + triage-conf:high
```

Final summary line uses `labeled` and `skipped` instead of `moved`:

```
Simulated N tasks: M labeled, S skipped, F failed
```

#### 9-real — normal branch (the rest of this step)

If `--simulate` is **not** active, continue with the move/create+move/skip logic below.

For **`move`**:
```bash
BODY=$(python3 -c 'import json,sys; print(json.dumps({"title": sys.argv[1], "project_id": int(sys.argv[2])}))' "$TASK_TITLE" "$TARGET_ID")
curl -s -w "\n__HTTP_%{http_code}__" -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $VIKUNJA_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "$BODY" \
  "https://todo.home.freaxnx01.ch/api/v1/tasks/$TASK_ID"
```

For **`create+move`** (do these in two API calls — never in one):
```bash
# 1. Create the new project
PBODY=$(python3 -c 'import json,sys; print(json.dumps({"title": sys.argv[1]}))' "$NEW_PROJECT_TITLE")
NEW_ID=$(curl -s -X PUT \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $VIKUNJA_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "$PBODY" \
  "https://todo.home.freaxnx01.ch/api/v1/projects" \
  | python3 -c 'import json,sys; print(json.load(sys.stdin)["id"])')

# 2. Move the task into the new project (same as the move case above, with $NEW_ID as target)
```

For **`issue`**: dispatch to the `/flowhub-issue` skill with the task id:

```
/flowhub-issue <task-id>
```

That skill (see `.ai/skills/flowhub-issue.md`) pulls the task's title/description/attachments from Vikunja, extracts issue title + body, creates the issue on the matched forge, and (on success) marks the Vikunja task done with the issue URL appended to its description. Do not duplicate that logic here; this skill only chooses the repo and hands off the id.

For **`skip`**: do nothing.

After each successful **`move`** or **`create+move`**, apply the `flowhub-triaged` label to the task:

```bash
curl -s -w "\n__HTTP_%{http_code}__" -X PUT \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $VIKUNJA_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"label_id":17}' \
  "https://todo.home.freaxnx01.ch/api/v1/tasks/$TASK_ID/labels"
```

The label `flowhub-triaged` (id 17, color `#7b68ee`) already exists in Vikunja. If the label assignment fails, log a warning but do **not** stop the apply loop — the move already succeeded and the label is non-critical tracking metadata.

After each row, print one line:

```
✓ #1 Sisu: Road to Revenge → Movies
✓ #2 Quote: Information … → Zitate/Quotes
✓ #3 https://example.com/random-thing → Notizen (created project #99)
- #4 reminder buy milk (skipped)
```

If a single API call fails (`__HTTP_<code>__` is not `200`/`201`), stop the entire apply loop, print the failing task and the response body, and report which rows did and did not apply. **Never silently swallow a failure.**

### Step 10 — Final summary

Print:

```
Triaged N tasks: M moved, K created+moved, S skipped, F failed
```

## Rules

- **Never** call `DELETE` on `/api/v1/tasks/*` or `/api/v1/projects/*` from this skill.
- **Never** invent a project id; only ids returned by Step 3 are legal targets.
- **Always** include `title` in `POST /tasks/{id}` and `POST /projects/{id}` payloads.
- **Never** persist the Vikunja token or Passbolt password to disk.
- If the user has not approved (`y`), no Vikunja state changes.
- If a task in the inbox has `done == true`, ignore it — don't propose, don't move.
- This skill never creates new *tasks* (only new projects, and only on explicit user accept).
